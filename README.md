### Steps to follow 📝

    - Download the repository to your local machine.

    - Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.

    - Import your notebook into Google Colab by clicking on File > Upload notebook and selecting the notebook file from your local machine.

    - Run all the cells in the notebook to install the required dependencies and launch the project.

It will take roughly 5 minutes to start-up the service. In the last cell it will appear a gradio link 

That’s it! You’re all set to use your project 🚀
